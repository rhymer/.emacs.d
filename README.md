# Cheng-An's Emacs Config

Many code snippets are borrowed from [Purcell's Emacs config](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d).

Use [John Wiegley](https://github.com/jwiegley)'s [`use-package`](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) and [Purcell](https://github.com/purcell)'s [`require-package`](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d/blob/master/lisp/init-elpa.el) to automate package installation.
